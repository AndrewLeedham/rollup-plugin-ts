### Reproduction

<!--
  Please provide a link to a reproduction. For simple bugs, it may be sufficient to just
  provide some inline example code here.

  A minimal reproduction is often necessary in order to fix bugs. If you do not provide
  a link to a reproduction or otherwise reproduction instructions, you may be asked to provide
  it. Please use one of the following:

  1. For simple bugs, it is fine to provide code examples directly in the issue.
     - If it depends on specific `tsconfig.json` settings and/or specific Rollup configuration, please use (2) or (3).
  2. Provide a minimal repository link (For example on Github).
  3. Provide a REPL link, for example on [repl.it/](https://repl.it/)

  With a reproduction, it is much more likely that the bug will be located and fixed quickly.
